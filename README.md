On April 25, 2015, a devastating earthquake struck
Nepal, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The
7.8 magnitude earthquake, along with several powerful aftershocks, destroyed or damaged thousands of buildings, homes,
and infrastructure, leaving many people homeless and without
basic necessities.
The problem of predicting earthquake damage to buildings
is a critical one, as it can help emergency responders and
city planners make informed decisions in the aftermath of a
disaster. In fact, a massive effort was undertaken to collect
data on the affected buildings and structures. This data was
collected and compiled into an extensive dataset, which has
been used for a variety of research and analysis purposes.
One important use of this dataset has been to train machine learning algorithms to predict the damage caused by
earthquakes. The goal of this report is to provide a detailed
analysis of these algorithms, a discussion of the results and
potential applications of the models developed.
In order to develop a robust machine learning algorithm,
some basics preprocessing steps have been applied.
